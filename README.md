Ocular artifact removal from EEG is often tackled with large neural networks, models with hundreds of thousands to millions of parameters, despite the task’s structural simplicity. We present a parameter-scaling study of lightweight convolutional denoisers that vary in depth, width, and grouped mixing, spanning orders of magnitude in size; from 41 parameters to 66k parameters. Across this sweep, performance exhibits a clear plateau once models reach a small parameter budget (only ~2k parameters); beyond that point, gains are marginal relative to added capacity. We explain this behavior theoretically, linking the artifact’s low spatial rank and band-limited temporal structure to the degrees of freedom of the optimal denoiser, thereby yielding a practical lower bound on the parameters required. Guided by this analysis, we introduce \emph{FemtoEOGClean}, a tiny model operating near the plateau that attains the desired accuracy while enabling edge deployment. Our femtomodels are at least 100x smaller than most networks designed for similar tasks, yet achieve competitive performance. To further assess generalisation, we curate a novel evaluation set from a publicly available dataset. These findings support size-aware design over overparameterization and establish a parameter lower bound for generalisable, lightweight EOG denoising.
